    SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (SELECT STATEMENT);

Count --> Aggregate function
    The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches the condition.
    syntax
    SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;


JOIN -->combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
--> The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
    syntax
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table1
    INNER JOIN table2
    ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
-->The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records (if any) from the right table (table2).
    syntax
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table1
    LEFT JOIN table2
    ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
-->The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records (if any) from the left table (table1).
